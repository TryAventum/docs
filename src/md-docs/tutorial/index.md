In this section, we will create full frontend applications backed by Aventum and we will go through the creation process step-by-step so get ready for the journey!

Please notice that if the tutorial project/example built using different frameworks is not necessarily the functionality will be the same in all frameworks, for example, the Blog project that built using React contains features more than the Blog project that built using Vanilla JavaScript. Also, we will focus on Aventum related stuff only so if you are not familiar with React for example don't skip the tutorial because what we will focus on that related to Aventum is pure JavaScript.
